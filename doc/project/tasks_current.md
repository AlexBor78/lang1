# Current working topic: Documentation

## main ideas (just for NOW here, in future in docs)
add `doc` directory, and some directories in it:
- api       - docs about compiler codebase (mostly generated by doxygen)
- lang      - docs about language itself (features, syntax, etc)
- project   - docs for project's life, like roadmap, tasks, issues, etc

## (Nears) Plans for now
- Documentation
    - reorganize docs
    - add doxygen
- Update stuff 
    - update keywords
    - update type's syntax, and type's Types (better wrappers with OOP)
    - impl base modules and remove namespace's
    - impl stack allocations (as in doc)
- make names more consistence

## Tasks:
- [X] reorganize and clean up docs
    - [X] tasks
    - [X] roadmap
- [X] move and clean up all docs we already had
- [ ] add doxygen to project, and write doc in code
- [ ] wite down all other code and architecture docs
- [ ] clean-up roadmap, dived notes and roadmap, sort all notes
- [X] remove clean.sh and run.sh and write one good script (not ai generated)
- [ ] decide gitignore generated doc or not
- [ ] mv doc -> docs
