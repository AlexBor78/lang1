# Current working topic: Documentation

## main ideas (just for NOW here, in future in docs)
add `doc` directory, and some directories in it:
- api       - docs about compiler codebase (mostly generated by doxygen)
- lang      - docs about language itself (features, syntax, etc)
- project   - docs for project's life, like roadmap, tasks, issues, etc

## (Nears) Plans for now
- Documentation
    - reorganize docs
    - add doxygen
- Update stuff 
    - update keywords
    - update type's syntax, and type's Types (better wrappers with OOP)
    - impl base modules and remove namespace's
    - impl stack allocations (as in doc)
- make names more consistence

## Tasks:
- [ ] reorganize and clean up docs
    - [ ] tasks
    - [ ] roadmap
