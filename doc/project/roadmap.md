# Project roadmap

## Global goals

### Version 0:0

#### Goals
- Minimal language (not all features implement (e.g. no structs), may contain bags, but can compile and execute code)
- basic FFI (to call C function)
- maybe basic std (only something like print, really basic)

### Abstract list of goals until version 1:0
- full 1:0 implementation of language
- basic std for work (io, data containers)
- increment build
- maybe support import C header (only for declarations, no implementations) (link implementations compiled by C compiler)
- language that ready for use and can be extended :)
