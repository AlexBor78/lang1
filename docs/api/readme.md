# Codebase documentation

Codebase now is not so small, and it need documentation, and its in progress.

## Structure

there is project [overview](./architecture_overview.md) about files and code

Also there are **pseudocode** of whole architecture of codebase, to have alternative overview,
**but** i didn't document decisions, and other important things **yet**.
Code documentation (references) mostly will be auto-generated by doxygen, 
but explanations about different decisions i will write manually <3.

**Autogenerated documentation is ignored by git**, right now it needs you to generate.
**In future:** it will hosted by GitHub Pages.

**Code already have some documentation in it, so for now - read that,**
(local link, appears only after docs generation)
AND [auto-generated](./generated/html/index.html) documentation
(link won't work, if you didn't generated documentation.
use `./project.sh generate-docs` if you copied repository,
OR copy it, bcs auto-generated docs is not hosted yet).
