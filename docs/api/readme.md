# Codebase documentation

Codebase now is not so small, and it need documentation, and its in progress.

## Structure

Right now there are only **pseudocode** of whole architecture of codebase, to have fast overview, **but** i will document decisions, and other important things.
Code documentation mostly will be auto-generated by doxygen, 
but explanations about different decisions and architecture i will write manually <3.

**Autogenerated documentation is ignored by git**, right now it needs you to generate.
**In future:** it will hosed by GitHub Pages.

**Code already have some documentation in it, so for now - read that,**
AND auto-generated documentation
