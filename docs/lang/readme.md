# Language documentation

Right now language is not implemented yet, and write full documentation about it is too early
**BUT** there are some ideas i want to document, just to don't forget,
**AND** some stuff is already implemented
**AND** for everyone to see main lang's flavour.

## List of content
- [modules syntax](./modules.md)
- [types syntax](./types_syntax.md)
- [stack allocation](./stack_allocations.md)
- [Ideas list](./ideas_list.md)

## [Ideas list](./ideas_list.md)

it's list of ideas i have, but not sure yet (they can change before implement, or even they wont be)
