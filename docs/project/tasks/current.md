# Current working topic: Documentation

## main ideas (just for NOW here, in future in docs)
add `doc` directory, and some directories in it:
- api       - docs about compiler codebase (mostly generated by doxygen)
- lang      - docs about language itself (features, syntax, etc)
- project   - docs for project's life, like roadmap, tasks, issues, etc

## (Nears) Plans for now
- [X] Documentation
    - [X] reorganize docs
    - [X] add doxygen
- [ ] Update stuff 
    - [ ] update keywords
    - [ ] update type's syntax, and type's Types (better wrappers with OOP)
    - [ ] impl base modules and remove namespace's
    - [ ] impl stack allocations (as in doc)
- [ ] make names more consistence

## Tasks:
Change done stuff -> new and actual ideas
- [X] new type's syntax AND ne type's Types design (to have infinity wrappers)
- [X] remove namespaces at all
- [X] update keywords
- [^] add keywords, nodes, etc for new features
- [^] pointer to function
- [ ] implement new modules (at list everything without increment build)
